                    Virat Kohli ( born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and former captain of the India national
                    cricket team. He plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League as a
                    right-handed batsman. He is often considered one of the best batsmen of his era and some critics believe him to be one
                    of the best limited-overs batsmen in history.[3] Between 2013 and 2022, he captained the India cricket team in 213
                    matches across all three formats. With 40 wins out of 68 matches, Kohli is one of the most successful Indian Test
                    captains.[4][5]
                    
                    Kohli made his Test debut in 2011.[6] He reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first
                    time in 2013.[7] He has won Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016). He also holds the
                    world record of being the fastest to 23,000 international runs.[8]
                    
                    Kohli has been the recipient of many awards– most notably the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy (ICC Men's Cricketer of the
                    Decade): 2011–2020; Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy (ICC Cricketer of the Year) in 2017 and 2018; ICC Test Player of the Year
                    (2018); ICC ODI Player of the Year (2012, 2017, 2018) and Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World (2016, 2017 and
                    2018).[9] At the national level, he was awarded the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in
                    2017[10] and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, the highest sporting honour in India, in 2018.[11]

            <p>
                In August 2008, Kohli was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.
                Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had played only eight List A matches.[44] So, his selection was called a "surprise
                call-up".[45] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were
                injured, Kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series.[46] He made his international debut, at the age of
                19, in the first ODI of the tour and was dismissed for 12.[47] He made his first ODI half century, a score of 54, in the
                fourth match.[47] He had scores of 37, 25 and 31 in the other three matches.[47] India won the series 3–2 which was
                India's first ODI series win against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.<br><br>
                After the postponement of Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in
                the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[50] He batted only once in the
                two-match series, and scored 49 in that innings.[51] Later that month in September 2008, he played for Delhi in the
                Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (winners of Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan) and top-scored for Delhi in both innings,
                with 52 and 197.[52][53] The match was drawn but SNGPL won the trophy on first-innings lead.[53] In October 2008, Kohli
                played for Indian Board President's XI in a four-day tour match against Australia.<br><br>
                Kohli, after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, returned to the national team replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir
                in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[55] He batted at number 4 for India in the 2009 ICC Champions
                Trophy because of an injury to Yuvraj Singh.[56] In the group match against the West Indies, Kohli scored an unbeaten 79
                in India's successful chase of 130 and was awarded man of the match award.[57] Kohli played as a reserve batsman in the
                seven-match home ODI series against Australia, appearing in two matches.[58] He found a place in the home ODI series
                against Sri Lanka in December 2009 and scored 27[59] and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj who
                regained fitness for the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury recurred leading to him being ruled out
                indefinitely.[60][61] Kohli returned to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI century–107 off
                114 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir, who made his personal best score of
                150.[47][62] India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1.[47] The man of the match was awarded to Gambhir who gave
                the award to Kohli.<br><br>

            <P>For the first Test of the Australian tour in December 2014, Dhoni was not part of the Indian team at Adelaide due to an
            injury, and Kohli took the reins as Test captain for the first time.[203] Kohli scored 115 in India's first innings,
            becoming the fourth Indian to score a hundred on Test captaincy debut.[204] In their second innings, India were set a
            target of 364 to be scored on the fifth day. Kohli put on 185 runs for the third wicket with Murali Vijay before Vijay's
            dismissal, which triggered a batting collapse. From 242/2, India was bowled out for 315 with Kohli's 141 off 175 balls
            being the top score.<br>
            <br>
            Dhoni returned to the team as captain for the second match at Brisbane where Kohli scored 19 and 1 in a four-wicket
            defeat for India.[96] In the Melbourne Boxing Day Test, he made his personal best Test score of 169 in the first innings
            while sharing a 262-run partnership with Rahane, India's biggest partnership outside Asia in ten years.[206] Kohli
            followed it with a score of 54 in India's second innings on the fifth day, helping his team draw the Test match.[96]
            Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket at the conclusion of this match, and Kohli was appointed as the
            full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney.[207][208] Captaining the Test team for the second time, Kohli
            hit 147 in the first innings of the match and became the first batsman in Test cricket history to score three hundreds
            in his first three innings as Test captain.[209] He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and the match ended in a
            draw.[210] Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests was the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia.<br><br>
            In January 2015, India failed to win a single match in the tri-nation ODI series against the hosts Australia and England. Kohli was unable to replicate his Test success in ODIs, failing to make a two-digit score in any of the four games.[47] Kohli's ODI form did not improve in the lead-up to the World Cup, with scores of 18 and 5 in the warm-up matches against Australia and Afghanistan respectively.
            In the first match of the World Cup against Pakistan at Adelaide, Kohli hit 107 in 126 balls. For his knock, he was
            Kohli batting against the UAE in Perth during a group stage match of the 2015 World Cup
            awarded the man of the match award.[211] Kohli also became first Indian batsman to score a century against Pakistan in a
            World Cup match.[212] He was dismissed for 46 in India's second match against South Africa. India went on to register a
            130-run victory in the match. India batted second in their remaining four group matches in which Kohli scored 33*, 33,
            44* and 38 against UAE, West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe respectively.[47] India went on to secure wins in these four
            fixtures and top the Pool B points with an undefeated record.[213] In India's 109-run victory in the quarter-final over
            Bangladesh, Kohli was dismissed by Rubel Hossain for 3, edging the ball to the wicket-keeper. India was eliminated in
            the semi-final by Australia at Melbourne, where Kohli was dismissed for 1 off 13 balls, top-edging a short-pitched
            delivery from Mitchell Johnson.<br><br>

            Kohli had a slump in form when India toured Bangladesh in June 2015. He contributed only 14 in the one-off Test which
            ended in a draw and averaged 16.33 in the ODI series which Bangladesh won 2–1.[214] Kohli ended his streak of low scores
            by scoring his 11th Test hundred in the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour which India lost. India won the next two
            matches to seal the series 2–1, Kohli's first series win as Test captain and India's first away Test series win in four
            years.<br><br>

            During South Africa's tour of India, Kohli became the fastest batsman in the world to make 1,000 runs in T20I cricket,
            reaching the milestone in his 27th innings.[216] In the ODI series, he made a century in the fourth ODI at Chennai that
            helped India draw level in the series.[217] India lost the series after a defeat in the final ODI and Kohli finished the
            series with an average of 49.[218] India came back to beat the top-ranked South African team 3–0 in the four-match Test
            series under Kohli's captaincy, and climbed to number two position on the ICC Test rankings.[219] Virat scored a total
            of 200 runs in the series at 33.33.

                    Virat Kohli is the leading run scorer in T20I with the most 50 plus scores.[400] He is the only cricketer to have been
                    awarded player of the tournament twice in the T20 World Cup.[400] He scored 319 runs with 4 fifties in T20 World Cup
                    2014 and was the leading run scorer in the tournament.[401]
                    
                    He has 2nd most centuries in ODI(43) and only behind Tendulkar who has 49 centuries.[402] He has 3rd most centuries(70)
                    in international cricket and only behind Tendulkar(100) and Ponting(71).[403] He is the fastest player to score 10,000
                    runs in ODI in terms of innings and took 54 less innings than previous record of 259 innings.[404] In 2018, He scored
                    1000 ODI runs in just 11 innings which is the least number of innings taken to score 1000 runs in a calendar year.[405]
